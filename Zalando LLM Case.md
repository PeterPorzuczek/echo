## ðŸ¤– Automating UI Component Library Migrations with LLMs

Great read from Zalando engineering on using LLMs to migrate complex UI component libraries efficiently. In my own work, I've faced similar challengesâ€”managing manual migrations or complicated codemods can quickly become overwhelming.
This article provided some valuable insights that I can apply directly: clear mapping of attributes, iterative approaches, and strategic use of LLMs for automating repetitive tasks.

Definitely recommended if you're tackling large-scale UI migrations!
