## TC39 JS 2025 - What‚Äôs Actually New in the Spec

The ECMAScript 2025 specification is now official. It introduces precise language enhancements that improve performance, readability, and ergonomic handling of data and asynchronous operations.

### Global `Iterator` Object

A new global object called `Iterator` has been introduced. It allows transforming existing iterable structures into an interface with functional operators. These operators are lazy and avoid creating intermediate arrays in memory. This leads to lower resource consumption and enables more expressive data pipelines.

```js
Iterator.from([1, 2, 3, 4])
  .map(x => x * 2)
  .filter(x => x > 4)
  .toArray() // [6, 8]
```

### New `Set` Methods

The `Set` object now includes a set of methods for performing mathematical set operations:

```js
a.intersection(b)
a.difference(b)
a.isSubsetOf(b)
a.isDisjointFrom(b)
```

These methods reflect familiar concepts from SQL and mathematics. They reduce boilerplate when working with collections.

### JSON Modules

The new specification includes official support for importing JSON files as modules. This allows direct inclusion of configuration data without requiring bundlers or loaders.

```js
import config from './config.json' with { type: 'json' }
```

This syntax simplifies data-driven development in both frontend and backend environments.

### `RegExp.escape`

A new static method `RegExp.escape` has been added. It escapes all characters in a string that would otherwise have special meaning in regular expressions.

```js
RegExp.escape('(a+b)') // "\(a\+b\)"
```

This function helps prevent injection issues when building dynamic patterns.

### `Promise.try`

The `Promise.try` method provides a unified way to handle functions that may throw synchronously or return a promise. It removes the need for explicit `try/catch` blocks.

```js
Promise.try(() => maybeSyncOrAsync())
  .then(handleSuccess)
  .catch(handleError)
```

This approach makes error handling consistent across different kinds of functions.

### `Float16Array` and `Math.f16round`

A new typed array called `Float16Array` stores 16-bit floating-point numbers. This format uses less memory and supports faster data transfer, which is useful in scenarios like neural networks and image processing.

The method `Math.f16round` rounds a number to 16-bit float precision.

```js
Math.f16round(0.333)
```

This feature enables efficient numerical computation where full precision is not necessary.

### Summary

ECMAScript 2025 focuses on expanding JavaScript with targeted features that address real-world development needs. These additions improve the developer experience when working with data structures, asynchronous logic, and low-level numerical operations. The specification represents a mature evolution of the language.

Many developers in the JavaScript community are supporting the open petition to make the name ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù a public domain asset. The initiative was started by the Deno team and has already gathered strong momentum. You can read the letter and add your name at [javascript.tm](https://javascript.tm). Every voice helps.
