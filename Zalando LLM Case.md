## 🤖 Automating UI Component Library Migrations with LLMs

Great read from Zalando engineering on using LLMs to migrate complex UI component libraries efficiently. In my own work, I've faced similar challenges, managing manual migrations or complicated codemods can quickly become overwhelming.
This article provided some valuable insights that I can apply directly: clear mapping of attributes, iterative approaches, and strategic use of LLMs for automating repetitive tasks.

Definitely recommended if you're tackling large-scale UI migrations!
