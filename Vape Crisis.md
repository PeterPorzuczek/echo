## 📢 Alarming Statistics on E-Cigarette Use Among Youth – Are We Aware of the Risks?

Recent studies show that 78% of high school students in Poland regularly use e-cigarettes, and 87% of them choose fruity or sweet flavors. Furthermore, 47.6% of students report daily use, and one in five opts for disposable models due to their easy accessibility.

### 🫁 “Popcorn Lung” – A Hidden Threat to E-Cigarette Users

Bronchiolitis obliterans, commonly known as "popcorn lung," is a serious lung disease that causes scarring of the smallest airways, leading to permanent lung damage. The name originates from cases among popcorn factory workers exposed to diacetyl, a chemical used to create buttery flavors. Research by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found diacetyl present in over 75% of tested flavored e-cigarettes and refill liquids.

### ❓ Does Legality Mean Safety?

Many parents and teens mistakenly believe that because e-cigarettes are legal, they must also be safe. Unfortunately, inhaling substances like diacetyl can lead to severe lung damage or even death. While e-cigarette use is currently not illegal, it's worth considering appropriate regulations to protect individuals who may be unaware of the potential health risks.

> ICD-10 code for bronchiolitis obliterans is J84.1 – Other interstitial pulmonary diseases with fibrosis.
