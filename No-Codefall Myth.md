## So, apparently, “No-code” and AI are about to wipe out developers… again. 👀 We’ve been here before.

Every few years someone shouts, “This is it! Devs are done! WE DID IT NO CODE!!!” Then we carry on coding, because, spoiler alert, tools don’t replace creativity, they amplify it. Want the full breakdown?

. Actual innovation usually pairs human problem-solving with tool-driven efficiency.  
. Smart devs adapt, adopt, and upgrade, so, no, we’re not going anywhere.
